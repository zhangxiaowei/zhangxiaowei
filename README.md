Was born in the late 90s, dropped out of school in 2015, and have been into software development for over 6 years.

I'm:

- A thinker, but rather doing than planning too far beforehand;
- A team player, like to collaborate effectively and provide help to people, except those who don't google first;

I usually work in my own rhythm, don't like being interrupted when concentrating on something.
